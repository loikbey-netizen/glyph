A modern, cross-platform markdown viewer and editor with platform-native styling.

Built with [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app), React 19, and TypeScript.

## Source Mindmap fork

This fork adds a source-aware Cards view for Markdown documents. Markdown remains
the single source of truth, while visual layout metadata is stored separately.
The product scope and implementation decisions live in
[`docs/product-overview.md`](docs/product-overview.md).

Source Mindmap installs alongside Glyph under its own Windows identity. Glyph
upstream releases are checked manually and reviewed in a dedicated sync branch;
the fork never installs an upstream binary automatically.

## Demo

## Try It

The [`samples/`](samples) directory is a tiny demo workspace. Open it as a folder (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O`) to see every rendering feature plus working wikilinks. [`samples/README.md`](samples/README.md) is the showcase document; the surrounding files exist so its `[[wikilinks]]` resolve.

## Features

### Markdown Rendering
- GitHub Flavored Markdown, alerts, footnotes, heading anchors, and emoji shortcodes
- Wikilinks and backlinks with hover preview and inline note embeds (`[[note]]`, `![[note]]`)
- Math (KaTeX), Mermaid and D2 diagrams, CSV/TSV tables, and syntax-highlighted code (6 themes)
- YAML frontmatter, sanitised inline HTML, and bidirectional (RTL) text
- Local and remote images with a zoomable lightbox
- Per-syntax toggles in Settings → Markdown

### Editor
- Source, split, and live-preview modes per tab
- New untitled (in-memory) documents (`Cmd/Ctrl+N`), save with `Cmd/Ctrl+S`, and an optional Auto Save toggle
- Format toolbar, inline formatting shortcuts, and wrap-selection
- Wikilink autocomplete, spell check, and Vim/VSCode keymaps
- Undo/redo for programmatic edits (task toggles, etc.)

### Workspace & Navigation
- Folder workspaces with a sidebar tree, tabs, and create/rename/move/delete; create a new workspace from within the app
- Graph view (`Cmd/Ctrl+G`), command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`, with `tag:` / frontmatter filters), a sidebar Tags panel, and in-document search (`Cmd/Ctrl+F`)
- Table of contents, resizable panels, zoom, and session/window restore
- Drag-and-drop, file associations, and a `glyph` CLI (`glyph file.md`, `glyph ~/notes/`)

### Viewer & Export
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and JSON Canvas (`.canvas`) boards
- Print and export to HTML, DOCX, EPUB, and PDF (vector diagrams, self-contained, offline)
- Export a whole workspace as a static website, in-app or headless from the CLI

### Sync (experimental)
- Per-workspace, Git-backed Cloud Sync to any remote you control, with a status-bar ahead/behind/dirty pill

### Appearance
- System / Light / Dark themes and platform-native styling (macOS vibrancy, Windows Mica)
- Localized, RTL-aware UI; customizable fonts, size, line height, and content width

### AI (optional)
- Chat sidebar, quick actions (summarize, explain, translate, simplify), and text-to-speech
- Providers: Claude, OpenAI, and Ollama (local)

### Platform
- macOS, Windows, and Linux; native menu bar with remappable shortcuts and update notifications
- iOS and Android (experimental): open and read single files, with a touch layout for phones and tablets; folder workspaces are desktop-only for now
- Plugins (experimental): extend rendering, palette, status bar, dictionaries, and themes; sandboxed by default with consent-gated permissions and checksum-verified marketplace installs (see the [plugin docs](https://glyph-md.github.io/plugins/))
- Local-first with opt-in crash reporting (off by default; see [Privacy & Error Reporting](#privacy--error-reporting))

## Install

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap glyph-md/tap
brew trust glyph-md/tap
brew install --cask glyph
```

`brew trust` is required once because Glyph ships from a third-party tap; recent Homebrew refuses to load casks from untrusted taps.

### Windows (winget)

```powershell
winget install hamidfzm.Glyph
```

### Windows (Chocolatey)

```powershell
choco install glyph
```

### Windows (Scoop)

```powershell
scoop bucket add glyph-md https://github.com/glyph-md/scoop-bucket
scoop install glyph
```

### Linux (Snap)

```bash
sudo snap install glyph
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S glyph-md-bin
```

### Linux (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap glyph-md/tap
brew install glyph
```

### Debian/Ubuntu (PPA)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hamidfzm/glyph
sudo apt update
sudo apt install glyph
```

### Debian

```bash
curl -fsSL https://glyph-md.github.io/apt-repo/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/glyph.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/glyph.gpg] https://glyph-md.github.io/apt-repo stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/glyph.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install glyph
```

### Fedora / RHEL (DNF)

```bash
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/glyph.repo < <(curl -fsSL https://glyph-md.github.io/rpm-repo/glyph.repo)
sudo dnf install glyph
```

### Linux (manual)

Download the `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/hamidfzm/glyph/releases).

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i glyph_*.deb

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install ./Glyph-*.rpm

# AppImage
chmod +x Glyph_*.AppImage
./Glyph_*.AppImage
```

### Command-line usage

Installing from a package manager puts a `glyph` command on your `PATH`:

```bash
glyph README.md      # open a file
glyph ~/notes/       # open a folder as a workspace

# export a workspace as a static website (headless; exits when done)
glyph ~/notes/ --export-website ./site
```

The website export runs without showing a window and exits nonzero on failure, so it can drive CI publishing (on Linux runners, wrap it in `xvfb-run`).

The command is provided by the Homebrew cask (macOS), Chocolatey or Scoop (Windows), and the deb package or Homebrew formula (Linux). The macOS `.dmg` and Windows MSI install the app only; use a package manager for the terminal command.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

Open a file or folder via CLI argument:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev -- -- /path/to/file.md
pnpm tauri dev -- -- /path/to/folder
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test                       # Run frontend tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:coverage              # Run with coverage report
cd src-tauri && cargo test      # Run Rust tests
```

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
pnpm lint                       # Lint TypeScript (Biome)
pnpm format:check               # Check formatting (Biome)
pnpm check                      # Lint + format + organize imports
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy    # Lint Rust
```

Note on "WYSIWYG / inline preview": Glyph's editor has split-view live preview and styled markdown tokens (bold/italic render as bold/italic in source), but markdown markers remain visible. Typora-style fully inline rendering is not implemented.

## Privacy & Error Reporting

Glyph is local-first: your documents are read and written on your machine. Nothing is uploaded anywhere unless you opt into Cloud Sync for a workspace, which pushes that workspace to a Git remote you control.

Crash and error reporting is **opt-in and off by default**. Nothing is sent until you turn it on in **Settings → Privacy → Send crash reports**, and even then it is only active in production builds (never during development).

When enabled, reports include only:

- Stack traces of the crash or unhandled error
- Operating system and Glyph version
- The error message

They never include your file contents, file paths, file names, or any links: these are stripped from every report before it is sent. You can turn reporting off again at any time from the same setting.

## Sponsors

Glyph is free and open source. These sponsors help keep it that way.
